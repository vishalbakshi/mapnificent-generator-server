# notes - MapnificentIntegration - 20190417.md

The purpose of this server is to handle requests from the client (Mapnificent) who will need the data in gtfs.bin files to be prepared by the `mapnificent.go` script.

The initial dataset can be loaded to Mapnificent on initial page load either in the existing Jekyll infrastructure or in some adaptation to SF Transit Riders server.

After that, any filters/interactions from the user that may result in only a subset of the data to be used for rendering the tiles (i.e. only one Bus line is chosen for viewing by the user) will require:

1. Conversion of database records/documents to be converted into some delimited file format
  - This can be handled by JS.
2. Conversion of those files to .bin 
  - This must be handled by the `mapnificent.go` script
3. Sending that .bin to the `loadData` function in `mapnificent.js` for further prepping before render.
  - This must be initially handled by the server that runs the `mapnificent.go` script

I have started by creating a Go server that can be hosted for free on Google's App Engine.
This Go server:

  - Should handle a GET request to transitfeeds for the initial dataset
  - Should handle GET requests from the Mapnificent Client (who will be sending some file) 
  - Should convert both requests to the structured binary file outfitted by `mapnificent.go`

This is what I'm starting out with for now. However, there may be a strong argument to add other functionality to this Go server.
