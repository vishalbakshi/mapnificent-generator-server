# notes - Mapnificent Integration - 20190425

Given that Mapnificent utilizes front end scripts for all data processing, it may be well worth it to use Firestore or Realtime Database instead of Cloud SQL.

The txt files should be easily converted to JSON via:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/csvtojson

Which can then be used to update the Firestore collection.

User interactions (selection of UI elements to filter the data), will be sent to Firestore via cloud functions, and the data returned should be converted back to txt and can be fed to Firebase Storage.  Finally, the txt files can be brought down and converted to the necessary .bin files using `mapnificent.go`, and returned to Firebase Storage. The `mapnificent.js` data URL would point to the Firebase Storage file URL.
